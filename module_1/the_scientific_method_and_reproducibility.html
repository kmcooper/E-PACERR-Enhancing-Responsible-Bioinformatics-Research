      <p>
        Individuals taking this course should remember the definitions of the fundamental tenets
        of reproducibility introduced by scientists Bland and Altman. For repeatability to be
        established, certain conditions must be in place such as the same location, measurement
        procedure, observer, measuring instrument, and experimental conditions with repetition
        occurring over a short period of time.
      </p>

      <h2>What does it mean to reproduce a project or an experiment?</h2>
      <p>
        For example, think of baking your family’s favorite cookie recipe, giving directions to a
        new location, or learning to perform a science experiment. To get to the desired end goal
        of the task, identify the order of the steps that could go wrong that would result in the
        task not ending as intended. Reproducibility happens in daily life but is also crucial to
        science and scientific experiments.
      </p>

      <h2>Reproducibility in Science</h2>
      <p>
        It is important for a scientist to follow the steps in a specific order to achieve their
        end goal. The Scientific Method is utilized by scientists to conduct their research and
        answer research questions. The steps of the Scientific Method include:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Identifying a problem, gathering data</li>
        <li>Creating a hypothesis (a possible explanation of an observation made in the natural world)</li>
        <li>Testing the formulated hypothesis by making an experiment</li>
        <li>Analyzing the results</li>
        <li>Drawing conclusions</li>
        <li>Disseminating the results to the scientific community</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        When formulating an experiment, it is important to consider the <em>existing body of evidence</em>
        in the scientific domain of interest. Note that <strong>one experiment is not sufficient to extend
        the current body of knowledge</strong>. Scientific theories emerge from different studies from hypotheses
        tested repeatedly and conclusions are drawn against existing research.
      </p>

      <h2>Bioinformatics in Health or Clinical Settings</h2>
      <p>
        For bioinformatics in a clinical setting, it is crucial that the scope of the work is clearly
        and effectively stated by researchers. When considering identifying a problem or formulating a
        question statement a scientist can create their own or modify an existing hypothesis. Perhaps
        an area has little research, but maybe there is a lot of research on the topic. When gathering
        data, one may gather primary data themselves or use data that is reusable. The use of existing
        data typically occurs from people sharing their data within data repositories.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the course of conducting research, the Scientific Method is rinsed through multiple
        times to build upon the evidence. For a hypothesis to be valid in scientific research, the hypothesis
        MUST be testable, falsifiable, explain natural phenomena, and successfully predict the results of
        future experiments which implies some aspect of reproducibility.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Expect</h2>
      <p>
        In the following portions of this module, we will discuss reproducing versus replicating research
        projects as well as how we can be sure that we are reproducing a given experiment correctly.
